Android service that hides and restores the honeycomb status bar.

<h2>Description</h2>
Android honeycomb contains a status bar that is always visible. In the status bar there are
controls to move back, to move to the home screen and to show all running applications.
The status bar also displays the clock, notifications and settings.<p/>
Android honeycomb cannot do without this status bar, as the user must always have the
ability to click on the back button. There is no physical button to go back, so the
status bar must always be displayed. Yet, there are times the user wants do have the extra
screen estate taken by the status bar. For instance when playing a movie.<p/>
Hide Bar can help with this. When running the Hide Bar service, a icon will be available
in the status bar. When clicking on this, a notification will be shown. If the
notification is selected, the status bar will hide itself. When the status bar is needed
again, a swipe at the bottom of the screen will bring the status bar back on top.

<h2>Limitations</h2>
Hide Bar expects root to work. I cannot help you with that. I would rather implement this
with public and documented api's. But alas, this is a hidden feature in Honeycomb. I'm
sure that, the day it gets documented, it will be part of the system and then there will
be no need for this application. But for now, this is the best we can do.

<h2>Hardware</h2>
This is a list of tablets the software is know to work with. Keep in mind that root is
required on all devices.
<ul>
<li/> Asus EEE Pad Transformer
<li/> Acer Iconia
</ul>
If your device is not in this list, don't despair. There is a big change it will work, I
am just not yet notified of this. If it works, email me, and I'll update the list. If it
does not work, also get in touch with me, so I know and can make it work. 

<h2>Download</h2>
You can download this application
<a href="https://github.com/downloads/ppareit/HideBar/HideBar_0_3.apk">here</a>. It will need to be side loaded. But as you already have root on your
device, you know how to install applications.
