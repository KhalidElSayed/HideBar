<h2>Description</h2>

Android tablets contain a system bar at the bottom that is always visible.
In the systembar there are controls to move back, to move to the home screen
and to show all running applications. The system bar also displays the clock,
notifications and settings.</p>

Android cannot do without this bar, as the user must always have the ability
to click on the back button. There is no physical button to go back, so the
status bar must always be displayed. Yet, there are times the user wants do
have the extra screen estate taken by the system bar. For instance when playing
a movie or a game. It is also a very nice companion for an e-reader or while
reading a pdf.</p>

Hide Bar can help with this. When running the Hide Bar service, an icon will
be available in the status bar. When clicking on this, a notification will be
shown. If the notification is selected, the bar will hide itself. When the
statusbar is needed again, a swipe at the bottom of the screen will bring the
systembar back on top. To help with the navigation inside application, there
is an invisible back button, I call it the ghost back button. You can enable
this from the settings.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>
This program should work on all rooted android tablets. Both HoneyComb and
Ice Cream Sandwich are supported. The newest android version, Jelly Bean is now
also supported. Some devices also need BusyBox installed.

<h2>Download</h2>
You can find the full application at the android
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.ppareit.hidebar">market</a>.
I used to have a demo version available on my own site, but due to some limitations of
the hosting company I can no longer provide the demo. I'm looking into putting a demo
on the android market.
</p>

If you need this application installed on many devices for the kiosk mode,
let <a href="mailto:pieter.pareit@gmail.com">me</a> know. I provide custom
builds depending on use case.
</p>

If the systembar does not hide, then make sure you have installed SuperUser and BusyBox
and both are of a recent version. BusyBox must be run after installation to work. Most
rooting methods install both applications but some leave that step to you.
