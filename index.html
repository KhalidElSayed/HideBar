Android service that hides and restores the systembar of android tablets.
This enables playing, watching and reading at full screen!

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
<li/>This application needs ROOT! Only install and use when you have
root+busybox+superuser!
<li/>Busybox must be installed and at least once run, a reboot is needed after
Busybox has been run.
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li/>First click on icon with two arrows to show notification, then on
notification to hide the system bar.
<li/>Tapping the bottom of the screen will reshow the system bar.
</ul>

<h2>Current bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li/>Some devices (ICS, JB) have a blinking wallpaper, use life wallpapers
to get around this. In the future, a fix will be provided.
<li/>Some devices (not many) are slow to reshow the systembar, up to half
a minute and the ghost back button does not work. Other than that,
everything else works.
<li/>It might display a message that the tablet is not rooted,
while you know that the tablet is rooted. This is because one of
the methods that tests for root depends on busybox. Then you need to
install busybox and run busybox at least once.
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>

Android tablets contain a system bar at the bottom that is always visible.
In the systembar there are controls to move back, to move to the home screen
and to show all running applications. The system bar also displays the clock,
notifications and settings.</p>

Android cannot do without this bar, as the user must always have the ability
to click on the back button. There is no physical button to go back, so the
status bar must always be displayed. Yet, there are times the user wants do
have the extra screen estate taken by the system bar. For instance when playing
a movie or a game. It is also a very nice companion for an e-reader or while
reading a pdf.</p>

Hide Bar can help with this. When running the Hide Bar service, an icon will
be available in the status bar. When clicking on this, a notification will be
shown. If the notification is selected, the bar will hide itself. When the
statusbar is needed again, a swipe at the bottom of the screen will bring the
systembar back on top. To help with the navigation inside application, there
is an invisible back button, I call it the ghost back button. You can enable
this from the settings.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>
This program should work on all rooted android tablets. Both HoneyComb and
Ice Cream Sandwich are supported. The newest android version, Jelly Bean is now
also supported. Some devices also need BusyBox installed.

Some features, such as the kiosk mode, have been implemented especially to support
commercial use. If you or your company has benefited from Hide Bar, you should consider
donating. Contact me if you or your company donated and wishes to be mentioned here.

<h2>Download</h2>
You can find the full application at the android
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.ppareit.hidebar">market</a> or download
the demo application <a href="https://github.com/downloads/ppareit/HideBar/HideBar_demo_1_8.apk">
here</a>. The demo version is fully functional. It will only show a small link to the market version
for a short while. The market version will not contain that link. The demo version needs to be side
loaded. The market version can be installed like all other android applications.
</p>

If you need this application installed on many devices for the kiosk mode,
let me know and I'll provide you with a build without the link to the market.
</p>

If the systembar does not hide, then make sure you have installed SuperUser and BusyBox
and both are of a recent version. BusyBox must be run after installation to work. Most
rooting methods install both applications but some leave that step to you.
