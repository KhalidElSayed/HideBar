Android service that hides and restores the status bar of android tablet devices.

<h2>Description</h2>
Android honeycomb contains a status bar that is always visible. In the status bar there
are controls to move back, to move to the home screen and to show all running
applications. The status bar also displays the clock, notifications and settings.<p/>
Android honeycomb cannot do without this status bar, as the user must always have the
ability to click on the back button. There is no physical button to go back, so the
status bar must always be displayed. Yet, there are times the user wants do have the extra
screen estate taken by the status bar. For instance when playing a movie.<p/>
Hide Bar can help with this. When running the Hide Bar service, an icon will be available
in the status bar. When clicking on this, a notification will be shown. If the
notification is selected, the status bar will hide itself. When the status bar is needed
again, a swipe at the bottom of the screen will bring the status bar back on top.

<li/> Version 1.0 (9/6/2012): Initial release for ICS! (This is an initial release, so expect it to be rough)

</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
Hide Bar expects root to work. I cannot help you with that. I would rather implement this
with public and documented api's. But alas, this is a hidden feature in Honeycomb (and even
more hidden in Ice Cream Sandwich). I'm sure that, the day it gets documented, it will be
part of the system and then there will be no need for this application. But for now, this
is the best we can do.
<p>
This program will remove the background wallpaper. This is a technical problem because the
system bar and the background picture are provided by the same proces. This can be solved
by using a live wallpaper.


<h2>Hardware</h2>
This program should work on all rooted android tablets. Both HoneyComb and
Ice Cream Sandwich are supported. Some devices also need BusyBox installed.

Some features, such as the kiosk mode, have been implemented especially to support
commercial use. If you or your company has benefited from Hide Bar, you should consider
donating. Contact me if you or your company donated and wishes to be mentioned here.

<p>
The following people/companies have donated:
<ul>
<li/>Alex Angelakopoulos, CEO of Masyn.
<li/>Matti Kari, CEO of Pieni Piiri.
</ul>

<h2>Download</h2>
You can download this application
<a href="https://github.com/downloads/ppareit/HideBar/HideBar_demo_1_3.apk">here</a>. This
is a functional demo version. It will show a small link to the market verions for a short
while. The market version will not contain that link. This version needs to be side loaded.
The market version can be installed like all other android applications.
</p>

If you need this application installed on many
devices for the kiosk mode, let me know and I'll provide you with a build without the link to
the market.
</p>

If the systembar does not hide, then make sure you have installed SuperUser and BusyBox
and both are of a recent version. Most rooting methods install both applications but some
leave that step to you.
